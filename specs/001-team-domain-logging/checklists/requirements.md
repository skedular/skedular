# Specification Quality Checklist: Team Domain Structured Logging

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-04-14  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass. Spec is ready for `/speckit.plan`.
- FR-001 through FR-006 enumerate every in-scope component explicitly, enabling implementation
  to proceed without ambiguity about what needs to change.
- Secret-safety rule (FR-007 / SC-2) is stated both as a requirement and as a success criterion
  so it acts as a hard review gate during implementation.
- Existing subscribers (LocationSubscriber, OrganizationSubscriber) are explicitly excluded
  from change unless a defect is found, preserving stability.
